This is a console-based Python project that allows users to convert units of weight and length using a text-based interface. The program repeatedly prompts the user for input and performs accurate unit conversions based on standard conversion formulas.

Features:

• Supports Weight conversion between:
  1. Kilograms ↔ Grams
  2. Kilograms ↔ Pounds
  3. Grams ↔ Pounds
  4. Pounds ↔ Kilograms
  5. Pounds ↔ Grams

• Supports Length conversion between:
  1. Feet + Inches ↔ Inches, Meters, Centimeters
  2. Inches ↔ Feet + Inches, Meters, Centimeters
  3. Meters ↔ Feet + Inches, Inches, Centimeters
  4. Centimeters ↔ Feet + Inches, Inches, Meters
